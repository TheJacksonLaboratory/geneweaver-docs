---------------------------

Data and web site providers make no guarantees or warranties as to the
accuracy or completeness of results obtained from accessing and using
information from GeneWeaver. We will not be liable to any user or anyone
else for any inaccuracy, error or omission, regardless of cause, in the
data contained in the GeneWeaver databases or any resulting damages. In
addition, the data providers do not warrant that the databases will meet
your requirements, be uninterrupted or error-free. Data providers
expressly exclude and disclaim all expressed and implied warranties of
merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. Data providers
shall not be responsible for any damage or loss of any kind arising out
of or related to your use of the databases, including without

Data Sharing Policy
-------------------

Data sharing in GeneWeaver is as broad or restrictive as the
investigator allows. When uploading data, it can be made private,
public or accessible only to selected groups. Access restrictions can
be changed at any time. All group members are also visible on the account setup page. The only people with access to your data are those who you
personally allow, or those who your group administrator(s) allow.
GeneWeaver will make no use of the data outside of normal metrics used
to optimize algorithm or database efficiency, or in other internal use
solely for the development of GeneWeaver, see [Privacy
Policy](#privacy-policy) for more.

In addition, our directives to share data stem from the NIH Data Sharing
Policy that states:

> Data should be made as widely and freely available as possible while
> safeguarding the privacy of participants, and protecting confidential
> and proprietary data.

Privacy Policy
--------------

-   In order to integrate data from many users, while protecting private
    data, we must store data on your server. User contact information is
    collected for optional display with your gene sets to foster
    collaborative research.
-   Entering user information is not mandatory.
-   User information will not be sold or otherwise distributed.
-   GeneWeaver records some information about how the site is used such
    as the IP address of machines accessing data sets. This information
    is used to monitor our system performance, to prevent abuse of the
    system, and to guide further development of the GeneWeaver. This
    information is stored on the server in files that are accessible to
    members of the development group. Specific information will not
    be released.
-   When you visit GeneWeaver, your use of the site is recorded in
    two ways. First, your use is logged by the Web server in standard
    log files. The IP address of your machine, the date and time, and
    the name of the page you visit are recorded. Second, for each
    request from the SQL database, the GeneWeaver records your IP
    number, the time, and the data set from which you
    request information. This information is collected for
    statistical purposes. Our system uses a software program (Analog) to
    create summary statistics that we find helpful in assessing patterns
    of data use, in measuring system performance and in
    detecting problems. This information is used to provide you with
    better internet service.
-   GeneWeaver also may request permission to place a so-called 'cookie'
    text file on your system to allow you to retain information on your
    set-up preferences.
-   For site security purposes and to ensure that this server remains
    available to users, this computer system employs programs that
    monitor network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload
    or change information, and to detect unusually high numbers of
    requests from single IP addresses. By accessing this site, you
    expressly consent to usage monitoring of this site for unauthorized
    or unusual activities. Unauthorized attempts to upload information
    and change information are prohibited.
-   In some cases, personal identifier information such as name or
    e-mail is requested or required. This information may be posted for
    public access along with the submitted comments and messages that
    it accompanies. In all cases, participation is strictly voluntary
    and no other use is made of the information. User data can be
    labeled as private, group or public on submission. Permissions can
    be changed. Gene sets that are not marked as public will not be
    included in global analyses of the database contents.
