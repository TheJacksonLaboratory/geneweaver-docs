External Data Resources
-----------------------

GeneWeaver contains publicly available sets of genes annotated to structured 
vocabularies and ontologies that are assigned Tier I, or public resource data. Other 
sets of genes, such as MeSH term-to-gene annotations, are derived from the processing 
of public sources and attributed to Tier II. In the case of MeSH, we take advantage of 
NCBI's gene-to-Pubmed and Pubmed-to-mesh files to produce sets of genes annotated 
through their transitive associations.
