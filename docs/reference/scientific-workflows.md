A scientific workflow is a series of interconnected tasks or computational steps 
that are designed to solve a specific problem or address a scientific question. 

[Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) and 
[Cromwell](https://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) are examples of tools that allow 
researchers to define, automate, and execute such workflows.

Scientific workflow can be beneficial when an analysis involves multiple steps, is 
complex, needs to be repeated, involves different platforms or environments, or requires
collaboration.

## Workflows in Geneweaver
Geneweaver uses scientific workflows to define analysis tools. This allows researchers
to define complex analysis tools that can be used by other researchers in the Geneweaver
web application.

For single step analysis tools, the workflow definition can be inferred by the 
Geneweaver web application. 

### Why Use Workflows?
Geneweaver uses scientific workflows as part of its analysis model for many of the 
same reasons scientists use them in their research. Utilizing workflow also allows
Geneweaver to utilize the same tools that scientists use to define and execute their
workflows.

In general, scientific workflows can be beneficial for the following reasons:

1) Reproduce scientific results: Workflows can be shared with others and executed on 
different platforms to ensure that scientific results can be replicated.

2) Scale up data processing: Scientific workflows can be executed on a variety of 
infrastructures, including cloud resources and high-performance computing clusters, to 
enable large-scale data processing.

3) Improve productivity: Workflows automate complex tasks and reduce the amount of 
manual intervention required, freeing up researchers' time for more creative tasks.

4) Ensure reproducibility: Scientific workflows provide a record of the steps taken to 
process data and can be used to ensure that results are reproducible and transparent.

5) Collaborate with others: Workflows can be easily shared and modified by collaborators, 
enabling more efficient and productive collaboration.
