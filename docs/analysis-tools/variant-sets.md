# Variant Sets

## Visualization

**Data**

The data of the raw Variant Set contains both variants and genes. The connection between each variant with its corresponding gene is saved in the data as well. 
The Variant Set utilizes different colors to indicate different genes and different evidences for the variants. 

The radius bar is used to customize the size of the node. This visualization supports mouse-hovering to highlight the genes of interest.
