GeneWeaver utilized a package based architecture to allow for the development of new
analysis tools and data types without requiring changes to the core GeneWeaver codebase.

The GeneWeaver project is composed of several python packages that are used to build the
GeneWeaver web application. These packages are also available for use in other projects.
