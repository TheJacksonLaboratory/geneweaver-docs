# Core Concepts

In this section, we will explore the fundamental concepts and principles that underlie 
Geneweaver. Understanding these core concepts is essential for gaining a deeper 
understanding of how the web application, analysis tools, and software packages work, 
and for using it effectively in your education, work or research.

In this section, we will cover key concepts such as definitions, data structures, and
algorithms, and will explore how these concepts are used in the context of Geneweaver.

Whether you are new to the tool or have been using it for some time, this section will 
provide you with the knowledge and understanding that you need to use the tool more 
effectively, and to get the most out of its capabilities. So, let's get started and dive
into the core concepts that underlie Geneweaver.
