## Genomic Features (Genes)
A genomic feature is any region of DNA that has a specific function or role in the 
genome. Some common genomic features include genes, exons, introns, promoters, and 
enhancers. Genomic features can be identified by a variety of methods, including 
sequencing, hybridization, and annotation.

In GeneWeaver, a genomic feature is a unique identifier for a genomic feature in a
particular organism, mapped from an external data source. Genomic features are the basic
unit of analysis, and are used the building blocks of GeneSets. 

Genomic features are important because they provide a framework for understanding the 
structure and function of the genome. 

## GeneSets
GeneSets are the fundamental unit of analysis in GeneWeaver.
A GeneSet contains a list of genomic features, free text descriptive content, ontology 
annotations and gene association scores. In GeneWeaver, Genomic features are mapped 
within and across multiple species. 

a researcher might use Geneweaver to analyze gene expression data from a set of cancer 
patients. By comparing the expression profiles of genesets associated with cancer 
pathways such as the p53 signaling pathway or the cell cycle pathway, the researcher 
might be able to identify genes or pathways that are dysregulated in the cancer samples.
