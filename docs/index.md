## Components of GeneWeaver
GeneWeaver is two things: 

1. A web application üñ•Ô∏è, and 
2. An ecosystem of software packages ‚öôÔ∏è.

**Genomics Researchers** will find the web application useful as a fully integrated 
platform for the analysis of heterogeneous functional genomics data.

**Educators**, **students** and **software developers** will find the ecosystem of 
software packages useful for the development of new tools and applications.

## What is this Documentation?
This documentation is intended to be the foundational documentation for the entire
Geneweaver software ecosystem. It provides an introduction to the system and ways of
working with it, explanations of core concepts, tutorials of general utility,
as well as detailed reference documentation for the various components and processes
that make up the system.

## GeneWeaver Use Cases
Your entrypoint to GeneWeaver will depend on who you are, and what you would like to
do with GeneWeaver. The following sections will help you find the right place to start
depending on our best guess as to your goals, based on who you are. Ultimately, you
will need to make your own decisions about what approach works best for you.

=== "Researchers üî¨"
    Geneweaver is a valuable resource for any genomics researchers looking to integrate and 
    analyze complex datasets in order to gain new insights into biological processes and 
    pathways.

    Geneweaver allows researchers to easily compare and combine datasets from various 
    sources and analyze the results in an interactive and user-friendly interface. The 
    system includes a large collection of publicly available datasets, including gene 
    expression data, protein-protein interactions, and gene ontology annotations, among 
    others. Geneweaver is a valuable resource for researchers in the field of genomics and 
    can be used to identify novel gene interactions and pathways, as well as to explore the 
    functional relationships between genes and biological processes.
=== "Educators & Students üìö"
    For educators, GeneWeaver provides a comprehensive platform for integrating real world 
    data and open sources software into the classroom. GeneWeaver provides data, tools, 
    systems, and workflows that can be used to teach students about genomics, 
    bioinformatics, computer science and data science. 

    GeneWeaver allows students and educators to integrate with a full cycle of development 
    and learning, starting with application to real-world concepts and data, and ending with
    the development and contribution of new tools and applications.

    The following disciplines might find GeneWeaver useful:

    - **Computer Science**
        - Algorithms
        - Software Engineering
        - Databases
        - Data Science
    - **Biology and Genomics**
    - **Bioinformatics**
    - **Mathematics**
=== "Software Developers üíª"
    For software developers, GeneWeaver provides a suite of open source software 
    packages that can be used for the development of new tools and applications. 
    GeneWeaver is built on a collection of open source software 
    packages. A software developer could use all or some of that ecosystem to build new
    applications and tools.

    Software developers can leverage the ecosystem of open source Python packages used 
    in Geneweaver.org through its package-based architecture to build new bioinformatics 
    tools and applications, contribute to existing packages, integrate with other tools,
    and address specific needs or gaps in the ecosystem.
