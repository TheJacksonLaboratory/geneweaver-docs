GeneWeaver is two things: 

1. A web application, and 
2. An ecosystem of software packages.

GeneWeaver is both a web-application and an ecosystem of software tools. It is a community driven project with the goal
of enabling and enabling and advancing Genomics Research, and providing a platform and community to enable students and
educators to engage with computational genomics in a variety of disciplines.

This website brings together the technical documentation for the Geneweaver project. This documentation is 
intended to be a resource for software contributors, educators and students, and scientific curators and genomic 
researchers.

## GeneWeaver for Educators

### Computer Science

### Biology

### Bioinformatics
