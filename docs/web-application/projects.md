# **Projects**

You must add a gene set to a project in order to be able to select it for analysis.
Projects consist of one or more gene sets. A gene set may be in many projects. A project
may be associated with private and/or public groups.

Projects can be created or selected in several places:

- Immediately after uploading a gene set
- Search results page
- My Projects page
- My GeneSets page

When using the My GeneSets page, click on each desired GeneSet, which is then
highlighted. Then click the Add to Project button.

## My Projects Page

You can get to the My Projects Page from the navigation bar or footer (under Manage
GeneSets) or from the icon in the center of the home page.

Use the search box to limit the list of projects by entering text that is included in
the project name(s).

Use the + on the left side of the project to show all its Gene Sets. Use the + on the
right side of the Gene Set to see its figure label, description, and authors.
