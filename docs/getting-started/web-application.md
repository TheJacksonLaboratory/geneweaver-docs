All users of the GeneWeaver systems will benefit from an understanding of the web
application. Fundamentally, all other parts of the GeneWeaver project are designed to
be building blocks for the web application.

### Basic Workflow
A basic workflow for a user of the web application is as follows:

!!! note "Step 1: Upload GeneSets / Search for GeneSets"
    A user needs to either upload their own data, or search for (and find) data that
    they are interested in using the GeneSet search tool.

!!! abstract "Step 2: Create Projects / View Projects & Tools"
    In order to analyze GeneSets, they need to be added to a project. So a user
    needs to either create a new project, or select an existing project to add
    GeneSets to.

!!! example "Step 3: Analyze"
    Once a user has added GeneSets to a project, they can then analyze the data
    using the tools available to them on the "Analyze GeneSets" page.

!!! question "Step 4: Interpret & Annotate Results"
    Once a user has analyzed their data, they can then interpret and annotate the
    results using the tools available to them on the "View Results" page.

!!! success "Step 5: User Groups & Sharing Data"
    Once a user has analyzed their data, they can then share their results with
    other users by adding them to a user group.
