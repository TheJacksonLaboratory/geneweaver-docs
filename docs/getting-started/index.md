=== "Researchers 🔬"
    Genomics researchers will find the web application to be the most straightforward
    way to get started with GeneWeaver. The web application is a fully integrated platform
    for the analysis of heterogeneous functional genomics data. Without ever leaving the 
    website, it will allow you to:

    - Search 🔍 for genomics data,
    - Upload 📤 and curate genomic data, and
    - Analyze 🏗️ and visualize genomic data.

    To learn more, you can either jump right in and head over to the
    [GeneWeaver Web Application](https://geneweaver.org).

    Or you can read the extensive documentation that is specific to the web application
    [Geneweaver Web Application Documentation](https://geneweaver.org/help/).

    General documentation on the available analysis tools can be found on the 
    [Analysis Tools](../reference/available-tools.md) page.

    If you want to run the analysis tools on your local computer, you can find more
    information in the [Running Tools Locally](./running-tools-locally.md) section.


=== "Educators & Students 📚"
    Educators and students will find the ecosystem of software packages to be the most
    straightforward way to get started with GeneWeaver. The ecosystem of software packages
    is a collection of python packages that are used to build the GeneWeaver web application.

=== "Software Developers 💻"
    If you just want to get started using Geneweaver to build cool stuff 💻, the 
    [Available Packages](../reference/available-packages.md) section might be what you
    want.
