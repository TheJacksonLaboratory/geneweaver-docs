# **Curation**

Controlling the quality and validity of the large-scale analysis of secondary data
requires the enforcement of interpretable standards for gene set construction and
description. GeneWeaverâ€™s use of discrete analysis eliminates many barriers to the
integration of heterogeneous data sets across species and experiments. However, it is
important for users to be able to rapidly interpret the nature of gene sets retrieved
from the site, requiring a minimal standard for metadata associated with secondary data.
For this purpose, both unstructured textual descriptions of the data and structured
ontology annotations to the terms in these descriptions are used to define gene sets.

Our **[Curation Standards](curation-standards.md)** provide detailed
guidance to GeneWeaver curation policies and sample curation types. We have also
included a brief explanation of the **[Curation Process](curation-process.md)**, which
includes a guide to our *new* curation interface.
