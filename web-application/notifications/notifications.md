**Notifications**
=================
Notifications are the mechanism GeneWeaver uses to send messages within the application.
There is also an option to receive email for notifications, which can be controlled from
the **[Account Settings](../users-and-groups/#accounts-page)** page.

Regardless of whether a user has been configured to receive
emails, they will always receive messages through the **Notifications** page. The fact
that you have pending notifications will be noted in the menu bar by a red indicator
over the envelope icon.

The **Notifications** page itself is fairly straight forward listing the notifications
that have not yet been seen in bold, and the rest of the notifications in normal font.
There is a button at the bottom of the page that allows you to **Load More Notifications
** so that you can get your full history of notifications.
