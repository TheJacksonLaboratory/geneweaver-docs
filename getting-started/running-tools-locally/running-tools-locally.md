!!! tip
    If you a researcher, you will find that the integrated tools in the
    [web application](https://www.geneweaver.org) are the most convenient way to run
    the analysis tools.

## Introduction

Geneweaver is designed to allow you to run the analysis tools on your local computer.
This pattern allows for developers to easily get started on tool development, and 
allows analysis tools to be delivered as independent research products in their own
right.

Running tools locally can also be useful if you want to run the tools on a large 
dataset, or if you want to run the tools on a dataset that is not available on the web 
application. However, the web application will almost always be the most convenient way 
to use the tools for most users, even with large datasets.

## Pre-requisites 
To run any of the tools, you will need to have access to data that you want to analyze.

In the examples below, we will utilize the 
[Command Line Interface](./command-line-interface.md) to provide data to the tools.

## Installation

!!! danger "Coming Soon"
    The local tools are currently in development, and are not yet available for 
    download. This section is a work in progress and will be updated as the tools become
    available.

=== "Container Image (Recommended)"
    The recommended way to run the tools locally is to use the container images that are 
    available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/geneweaver).

    ### Requirements
    To run the tools locally, you will need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) 
    installed.

    ### From Docker Hub


=== "From Source"
    To run the tools locally, you will need to download the source code for the specific
    tool that you want to run, and then install the dependencies for that tool. Each 
    tool has its own repository, and each repository has its own documentation.

    ### From Source

    ```bash
    git clone


## Usage
The specific usage of each tool will vary by tool, but each follows a similar pattern.
